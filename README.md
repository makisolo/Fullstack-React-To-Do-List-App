Users can add a task by simply clicking the plus sign on the bottom right of the screen. Then, a text menu will pop up in which users can pass through some text, and after clicking the "create task" button, the text will appear on the screen in the form of a to-do list. Once a task is completed, users can click on the task in order to cross it off from the list. Tasks can also be deleted by clicking the "x" button located on the far right hand side of every task.
